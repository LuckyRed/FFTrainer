    <system:String x:Key="Question5">5.) How can we switch into an NPC such as Lyse or Yotsuyu?</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Question6">6.) I want to make Report of a Bug/Suggestion to this trainer.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="A1">A.) On FFXIV, perform any simple or non-persistent emote such as /wave or /yes. Enter /gpose in-game then while in /gpose check the box to "freeze" which allows you to edit the number box. Enter the value of the desired action, let's use value 30 as an example to test which is Sprint. ( Make sure your character isn't paused.)</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="A2">A.) Yes, you can get banned by using this trainer, but you should be fine as long as you don't use this to harass another player in-game, don't share your beloved screenshots/streams/videos with this trainer under the Square Enix trademark and don't talk about this trainer in-game as you would with parsers/ACT or modding in general.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="A3">A.) Look for them yourself, ask a friend, Google FFXIV Datamine or people in our discord server. I am not the one you should be asking for these since I don't know them by heart nor do I know the list.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="A4">A.) Change whatever appearance or equipment you want and go to /gpose or Re-zone to new instance/zone/map to see the changes.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="A5">A.) You cannot switch your model into NPC, the game has currently patched that to make that possible. However you're able to wear the NPC gears.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="A6">A.) If you want to make a report or a suggestion to help support this trainer become better, either message me in discord or make a post in our discord server under the appropriate channel.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="faq">Frequent Asked Questions</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="Aboutx">About:</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="AboutText">This trainer's base code was made by LeonBlade and then the project continued with Johto working on it. This application uses the following libraries in this project: MahApps, Fody, AutoUpdater.Net, Newtonsoft.Json and Memory.dll. This project uses portions of the code from the Wardrobe, thanks to Goat helping out.</system:String>
